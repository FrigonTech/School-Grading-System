# School-Grading-System

This is a versatile C# standalone application software for managing day-to-day school centric activities easily by the administrative department. This also has a dark and light mode (more themes coming soon!), use what you like. We'll also work on improving the theme system where you will be able to create new themes yourself (not necessary so this is yet to be worked upon).
